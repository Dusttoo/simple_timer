# Pomodocado - Pomodoro style timer
---
This project is built with React and is a simple countdown pomodoro timer. A user can set a timer for work or break time and then select an amount of time for that timer. As the time passes, the avacado starts to disappear if you are in work time and reappear if you are in break time.
